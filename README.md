Welcome, this is a Repository I am using to upload the various codes to solve worksheets I am recieving on a weekly basis. As well as to document the work I am doing in the lab. To be able to use all the code, you wil need to install the following libraries:

- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- kafe2
- pandas
- uncertainties
